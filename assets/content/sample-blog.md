## Before we begin...

We're going to go through some of the IDE configurations and tools to give our productivity a **10x** boost!

I am a developer, and you're reading this because you are interested in improving further. Either you are a developer, or you may be not, but one thing is sure, you're curious about this! And that is enough to get started to OverPower your skills.
Now that's enough pep-talk, let's dive in!

## The Tools

Comparing how a building construction worker puts brick-layers one above the other and uses tools to bind them correctly, software development is not much different. With the right tools, we'll be able to build beautiful code that works like magic!

## IDE :computer: as powerful as an IED :boom:

The software you use to develop software plays a HUGE role in how easy it is for you to develop. As a developer, you want to get things done quickly, and with better accuracy and efficiency.

Now that we're on the same page, your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) must be powerful enough so that all those repetitive, boring, and stupid things that take your time, would be done by the IDE for you. And you focus on the actual business logic that matters. Let's talk about two of the best IDEs there are,
[IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) & [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Choose one of these two for now, and let's begin to set it up real nice!

## IntelliJ Idea

IntelliJ Idea gives out of the box support for A LOT of development frameworks and language standards, literally, A LOT.

If you're using the Community Edition, you get support for

- Java
- Groovy
- Android SDK with Flutter & Dart
- Scala
- Kotlin (duh!)

It gives Maven & Gradle support to build your application. Pretty sweet right? But, it may not be enough.

If you're working in a start-up, you're probably working on NodeJS project and some kind of SPA UI that uses Angular, React, VueJS, or something like that. This is where it becomes _difficult_ to use IntelliJ Idea CE for your development.

If you purchase the Ultimate edition, you get access to everything that JetBrains provides into a single IDE. For example, Database client (DataGrip), UI Development IDE (WebStorm, PhpStorm), Python Development IDE (PyCharm), CI/CD Tool (TeamCity), etc. is available to you in a single software IntelliJ Idea Ultimate. The exhaustive list of features is [available here]().

### Pump up your IntelliJ

Letâ€™s add some plugins to this already feature-rich IDE to make it a BEAST!

- **Sonarlint**: The OG static code analysis tool
- **Docker**: Simulate production environment on your local setup!
- **PlantUML** Plugin: One of the easiest mind-map and design visualization language framework!
- **IdeaVIM**: If you're a `vim`-head, this one's for you!
- .i* Ignore: ignore those .i* files
- **ESLint**: A real-time tutor about Clean Code and Standard Development practices for you
- **One Dark Theme**: One of the cleanest and eye-soothing UI themes!
- **Prettier**: Extension that formats your code for you

Instructions to install these plugins and how to use them can be found at the bottom of this article in the appendix section.

## VS Code

VS Code is an open source IDE developed by Microsoft and supports a variety of languages and frameworks for software development. It is my 2nd choice for an IDE if IntelliJ Idea is not available.

VS Code is specifically tuned to cater the start-up and open source development in the sense that it has better support for MEAN stack development.

It's free to download and use and provides great support with community supported extensions for languages and frameworks.

### Pump up your VS Code

Unlike IntelliJ Idea Ultimate, which brings out-of-the-box support for almost every language and framework, VS Code brings that support with the help of extensions. Let's add some must-have extensions to your VS Code and upgrade it!

- **Angular Language Service**: Extension for Angular Development
- **ESLint**: Keep your code clean, and up to industry standards
- **Eclipse Keymap**: If you're coming from Eclipse
- **Docker**
- **SonarLint**: Static code analysis tool for you!
- **JetBrains Icon Theme**: If you want your VS Code project structure to look like IntelliJ Idea
- **Language Support for Java(TM)**: Java support for VS Code
- **Lombok Annotation Support**: Lombok Annotation processor for VS Code - this way, VS Code won't cry for compilation errors when you access getters and setters for your POJOs that have Lombok annotations!
- **Maven for Java**: Maven execution support for VS Code
- **npm**: npm support for VS Code
- **One Dark Theme**: A must have theme!
- **Prettier**: The code formatter you need
- **Spring Boot Extension Pack**: Extension pack to get you started with Spring Boot development
- **Typescript Debugger**: Debugger for Typescript code execution
- **WSL**: Windows Subsystem for Linux Support for Windows users

## Take shortcuts! :motorway:

I'm sure you already know the prowess of `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V`. Some say, it is the first teacher for a software developer in the line of active duty!

What it translates to, is that with the help of keyboard shortcuts, one can do something much faster than if they were to take the usual route. Let's talk about some common and usable shortcuts to help you churn through more code, and handle changes in a very optimized way.

You will find a shortcuts cheat sheet attached at the bottom of this article in the appendix section. It's a txt file, you may download it, and set it in your IDE. I have purposefully not extracted it into IDE specific formats for it to be usable by a larger audience.
