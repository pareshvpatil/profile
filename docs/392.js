We'll cover 10 aspects, each adding 1x optimization to our efforts.\n\n  I myself am a developer, and you're reading this because you are interested in this topic. Either you are a developer, or you may be not, but one thing is sure, you're curious about this! And that is enough to get started to OverPower your skills.\n  Now that's enough pep-talk, let's dive in!\n\n  ## The Tools\n\n  Comparing how a building construction worker puts brick-layers one above the other and uses tools to bind them correctly, software development is not much different. With the right tools, we'll be able to build beautiful code that works like magic!\n\n  ## IDE :computer: as powerful as an IED :boom:\n\n  The software you use to develop software plays a HUGE role in how easy it is for you to develop. As a developer, you want to get things done quickly, and with better accuracy and efficiency.\n\n  Now that we're on the same page, your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) must be powerful enough so that all those repetitive, boring, and stupid things that take your time, would be done by the IDE for you. And you focus on the actual business logic that matters. Let's talk about two of the best IDEs there are,\n  [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) & [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\n  Choose one of these two for now, and let's begin to set it up real nice!\n\n  ## IntelliJ Idea\n\n  IntelliJ Idea gives out of the box support for A LOT of development frameworks and language standards, literally, A LOT.\n\n  If you're using the Community Edition, you get support for\n  - Java\n  - Groovy\n  - Android SDK with Flutter & Dart\n  - Scala\n  - Kotlin (duh!)\n\n  It gives Maven & Gradle support to build your application. Pretty sweet right? But, it may not be enough.\n\n  If you're working in a start-up, you're probably working on NodeJS project and some kind of SPA UI that uses Angular, React, VueJS, or something like that. This is where it becomes _difficult_ to use IntelliJ Idea CE for your development.\n\n  If you purchase the Ultimate edition, you get access to everything that JetBrains provides into a single IDE. For example, Database client (DataGrip), UI Development IDE (WebStorm, PhpStorm), Python Development IDE (PyCharm), CI/CD Tool (TeamCity), etc. is available to you in a single software IntelliJ Idea Ultimate. The exhaustive list of features is [available here]().\n  "}ngOnInit(){this.route.paramMap.subscribe(o=>{console.error(o.get("blogSlug"))})}doSomething(o){this.content=o}}return t.\u0275fac=function(o){return new(o||t)(e.Y36(s.gz))},t.\u0275cmp=e.Xpm({type:t,selectors:[["app-blog-content"]],decls:29,vars:17,consts:[[1,"col-8","mx-auto"],[1,"py-4"],[1,"mt-4"],[1,"font-sans-serif","mb-0","mt-4","fw-bold"],[1,"content-wrapper","d-flex","justify-content-between"],[1,"content","col-9","pe-4","mt-4"],[1,"my-3","flex","align-items-center","text-end","w-100"],[1,"me-3","fw-light","text-secondary"],[1,"text-secondary","fw-light","fs-7"],["emoji","","src","/assets/content/sample-blog.md",3,"load"],[1,"content-info","col-3","ps-4","d-flex","flex-column","justify-content-start","mt-4"],[1,"text-warning","fw-bold","mb-4","ms-auto","fs-3"],[1,"d-block","text-primary","text-truncate","text-end","mt-2","ms-auto"]],template:function(o,r){1&o&&(e.TgZ(0,"div",0),e._UZ(1,"div",1)(2,"app-top-banner",2),e.TgZ(3,"h1",3),e._uU(4,"Increase your productivity with these cool tricks!"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(5,"div",4)(6,"div",5)(7,"div",6)(8,"span",7),e._uU(9),e.ALo(10,"date"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(11,"span",8),e._uU(12),e.ALo(13,"readingTime"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(14,"markdown",9),e.NdJ("load",function(l){return r.doSomething(l)}),e._uU(15,"\n      "),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(16,"div",10)(17,"span",11),e._uU(18,"Related Topics"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(19,"a",12),e._uU(20,"Set up Docker on your PC"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(21,"a",12),e._uU(22),e.ALo(23,"truncate"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(24,"a",12),e._uU(25,"Getting Things Done!"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(26,"a",12),e._uU(27),e.ALo(28,"truncate"),e.qZA()()()()),2&o&&(e.xp6(9),e.Oqu(e.lcZ(10,4,r.articleDate)),e.xp6(3),e.hij("",e.xi3(13,6,r.content,300)," min read"),e.xp6(10),e.Oqu(e.Dn7(23,9,"Clean Code: A Subjective Guide for better programming",25,!0)),e.xp6(5),e.Oqu(e.Dn7(28,13,"Setup Your Machine: Java",25,!0)))},dependencies:[d.lF,g,m.uU,f,h],styles:[".table[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{--bs-table-striped-bg: #fcfcfc;--bs-table-hover-bg: #e9ecef}.table-secondary[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{--bs-table-bg: #f8f9fa}.blog-summary[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{font-family:Merriweather,serif;line-height:1.5}.blog-content[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{font-family:Merriweather,serif;font-size:1.15rem;line-height:1.75;color:#4a5159;margin-top:2rem}.content-info[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{border-left:2px solid #f8f9fa}"]}),t})();var y=a(1154);const c=function(){return["./blog/some-blog"]},v=[{path:"",component:(()=>{class t{constructor(){}ngOnInit(){}}return t.\u0275fac=function(o){return new(o||t)},t.\u0275cmp=e.Xpm({type:t,selectors:[["app-blog-list"]],decls:26,vars:4,consts:[[1,"col-8","mx-auto","mt-4"],[1,"text-dark","fw-bold","text-uppercase"],[1,"col-12","d-flex","flex-wrap","justify-content-between"],["href","/blogs/blog/some-blog",1,"blog-card","col-3","mx-auto","rounded","rounded-4","border","p-4","border-light","d-flex","flex-column"],[1,"fs-3","text-primary","fw-bold"],[1,"text-secondary"],[1,"blog-card","col-3","mx-auto","rounded","rounded-4","border","p-4","border-light","border-2","d-flex","flex-column",3,"routerLink"],[1,"blog-card","col-3","mx-auto","rounded","rounded-4","border","p-4","border-light","d-flex","flex-column",3,"routerLink"]],template:function(o,r){1&o&&(e.TgZ(0,"div",0)(1,"h1",1),e._uU(2,"Blogs"),e.qZA(),e._UZ(3,"p-divider"),e.TgZ(4,"div",2)(5,"a",3)(6,"p",4),e._uU(7,"Clean Code: A Subjective guide for better programming"),e.qZA(),e._UZ(8,"p-divider"),e.TgZ(9,"div")(10,"span",5),e._uU(11," Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
